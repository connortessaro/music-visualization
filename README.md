# Score for Listening – Le1f “Wut”

This repository contains the Python code used to generate a visual “score for listening” for the song **Le1f – “Wut”**, created for the MUSC 1001 project *Describing Music Visually*.

The visualization is intended as a listening map rather than performance notation, emphasizing bass weight, rhythmic pressure, texture, dynamics, and structural drops.

## Files
- `visualization.py` – main script that generates the visual score
- `visual_intepretation_leif-wut.png` – final exported image

## Requirements
- Python 3
- numpy
- librosa
- matplotlib

## Usage
Run the script after placing the audio file in the same directory:
```bash
python visualization.py
